          <h5>WordPress Blog</h5>
          <br>
          <p>Originally, this site was a project from a WordPress course in which I utilized PHP, customized templates and plug-ins, and edited functions to acheive a unique design.  Now it functions as a personal blog to update my family and friends on my progress with school.</p>

          <h5>Professional WordPress Exercise</h5>
          <br>
          <p>This site is an exercise in locally editing an existing WordPress site downloaded from GitHub, using a child theme and staging site.  The class gave me a simulated client experience including advanced customization of pages, posts and newsletters.  I also learned to implement rss and social feeds and social sharing icons.</p>

          <h5>Multi-page Responsive Webpage</h5>
          <br>
          <p>This site is a class project using an HTML5 boilerplate template to create a responsive three page site for a fictional company.  I used Flexbox CSS properties and media queries to adjust the layout between mobile, tablet and desktop screensizes.</p>

        <h4>Tireless and Flexible</h4>
        <p>As a student in <a href="https://skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a>, I've completed courses in HTML, CSS Flexbox, PHP, Wordpress and web design, and am well equipped to produce custom, modern websites.  I'm a great match for small business owners looking to update their site or create one from scratch.</p>
        <p>I have some unique past experience in marketing and the arts. With a local solar company, I rose from door to door marketer to Director of Outside Marketing, in charge of 80 representatives.  My teams accounted for 95% of the leads generated in the first five years, those leads accounted for 750k in gross sales year 1 and grew to 35 million in year 5.  I attribute my performing arts experience to this success.  The ability to take direction, connect with humans and perform under pressure in a creative environment on strict deadlines are translatable skills to almost any profession.</p>
        <p>Why hire a web developer in training? Value. I'm currently able to offer high quality work at extremely competitive rates in order to supply my portfolio with shining examples and references.</p>

      <div id="about-me" class="full-width">
        <p>When the pandemic hit I was pursuing my passion as a union stage actor and performer.  With no end in site I decided a career in tech would be a valuable and safe alternative career path.  Luckily, after diving in it has turned into a new passion.  I'm motivated in helping others adapt to our new reality as our priorities change and we put more focus online.  I'm also motivated by our growing interest in social change, and will be prioritizing clients who share ethical humanist and progressive values.  When we're not in the middle of a global pandemic, you can typically find me groovin on the dance floor, singing karaoke or adventuring the great outdoors.</p>
