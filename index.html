          <h5>A One Page WordPress Site</h5>
          <br>
          <p>I designed this first&dash;version WordPress site in collaboration with Military Movies, Inc. In order to build this site with a quick turnaround, I stripped down an existing theme, and created a child theme to style the front page as an HTML/CSS document, rather than dealing with plugins for the block editor. I focused plugins on speed optimization and SEO, utilizing Google Analytics.</p>

          <h5>Professional WordPress Exercise</h5>
          <br>
          <p>This site is an exercise in locally editing an existing WordPress site downloaded from GitHub, using a child theme and staging site.  The class gave me a simulated client experience including advanced customization of pages, posts and newsletters.  I also learned to implement RSS and social feeds and social sharing icons.</p>

          <h5>A Responsive Website</h5>
          <br>
          <p>A multi-page project site in HTML/CSS.  I was given a Photoshop psd and tasked with building the site to match the psd.  As a responsive site, the layout changes to accommodate the size of the screen using Flexbox CSS.  This Portfolio site is made using the same type of code.</p>

    <h2>about me</h2>
    <div id="about-content">  
      <div id="about-description">
        <p>As a freelance web developer, I am well equipped to design and produce custom, modern websites in HTML/CSS or the WordPress CMS. I'm a great match for artists and small business owners looking to update their site, create one from scratch, or boost their marketing and SEO.</p>
        <h4>Tireless and Flexible</h4>
        <p>I have some unique past experience in marketing and the arts. With a local solar company, I rose from door to door marketer to Director of Outside Marketing, in charge of 80 representatives.  My teams accounted for 95% of the leads generated in the first five years, those leads accounted for 750k in gross sales year 1 and grew to 35 million in year 5.  I attribute my performing arts experience to this success.  The ability to take direction, connect with humans and perform under pressure in a creative environment on strict deadlines are translatable skills to almost any profession.</p>
        <h4>Look at Me Now</h4>
        <p id="hire">I'm currently able to offer high quality work at extremely competitive rates in order to supply my portfolio with more shiny examples and references. If you're considering making your own cheap site, talk to me first.  I can save you time, headaches, and most likely, money&excl;</p>
      </div>
      <div id="about-me" class="full-width">
        <h4>Passion and Drive</h4>
        <p>When the pandemic hit I was pursuing my passion as a union stage actor and performer.  With no end in site I decided a career in tech would be a valuable and safe alternative career path.  Luckily, after diving in it has turned into a new passion.</p>  
        <p>I'm motivated in helping others adapt to our new reality as our priorities change and we put more focus online, and am excited about our growing interest in social change. When I'm not at work or perfecting my code, you can find me on the local disc golf course, dreaming about the time I can get back onto the dance floor with my friends as I trail the gentle curve of my disc floating between the trees.</p>
